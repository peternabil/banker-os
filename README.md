# banker-os


this project is an assignemt for the course operating system 

this is an implemention of Bankerâ€™s algorithm. 
Several processes request and release resources and the algorithm will grant a request only if it leaves the system in a safe state. 
A request that leaves the system in an unsafe state will be denied. 
The algorithm will consider requests from n customers for m resources types.
Processes will continually loop requesting and releasing resources from the system. 
The processes request and then release random numbers of resources, which are bounded by their respective values in the need array.
